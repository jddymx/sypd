title: Grouping series audiobooks on iOS
---

In prep for the upcoming post-thanksgiving road trip I've been loading my phone up with audiobooks. The thing of it is, we like series books, and they are always such a mess in the main book list. Why can't I group them up like discs in an album? Turns out you can, if you know *exactly* how to tag them in iTunes.

For the sake of this example I'm going to tag The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a radio series of 5 different stories. Tagging is pretty simple once you know what to do.

* Set the "Album" to the series name, in this case "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
* Set the "Name" to the book's name, our first book is "Primary Phase"
* ***Do not*** set the track number fields. If you do the book will display as "Part 1 of 5"
* Use the "Sort name" field to ensure the books sort in the right order within the series. I used "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 1" for the first book, "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 2" for the second, and so on.
* If you have a multi-file book that you can't combine into a single file, tag "(Part 1)" on the end of "Name" and add a second number onto the "Sort name": "Iron Druid 3 1"

When all is said and done, you'll end up with a base list that has each series, and then within the series you'll see each book as a "part".
