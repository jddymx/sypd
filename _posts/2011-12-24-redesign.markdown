title: Some redesignin'
---

Hope everyone likes the new look. Since I've been spending less time in WoW these days I figured I'd redesign stuff to focus on my ramblings instead.  Never fear, I've not abandoned my addons, I've simply moved them off the front page. There will be more to come, but for now I have to go try to pass out so I can get up at a reasonable time (heh, **noon**) before xmas company arrives.
