After far too long of a wait, I've finally compiled Northrend TourGuide files for horde.  As usual, you can find the download at "WoWInterface":tg.

A big huge thanks is due to "Spugnort's guides":spug.  After the "development policy":pol was laid down by Blizzard, their TourGuide files could no longer be given to paying customers only.  Instead of removing their in-game guides, or simply ignoring the policy like some other guide authors (I won't name names...), they instead donated their guides for the betterment of TourGuide for everyone.

I've gone through each guide, merging in ally guide data for the neutral quests and the quests that are similar for both factions.  "TourGuide Recorder":tgr data from users (thanks guys!) has also been merged in, so you should get some nice coords even if you don't run "LightHeaded":lh.

Again, big thanks to everyone that made this possible.  Even though I'm usually not one for paid guides (hell, I wrote TourGuide to undermine the ones that I thought were poor quality, especially for a paid product...), I encourage you guys to hit up "Spugnort's":spug and show them some support for donating their guide data for everyone to use.

Oh, and if any of you hordies out there have the time, I'm still missing a guide for Storm Peaks.  You could use the ally guide as a starter, since 2/3 of the zone are neutral quests.
